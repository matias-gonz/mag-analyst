Curve type:
* Anhysteretic curve

Material:
* A grain-oriented silicon steel (M130-27 s) measured parallel to the rolling direction

Details of the measurement:
* Acquired by the fluxmetric method on an Epstein test frame. Measurements were carried out with a magnetizing field frequency of 0.5 Hz at room temperature using a digitally controlled hysteresisgraph.
