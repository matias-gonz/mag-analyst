Curve type:
* Anhysteretic curve

Material:
* A non-oriented electrical steel (JNEX-900)

Details of the measurement:
* Characterized using an Epstein frame under quasi-static excitations. The quasi-static hysteresis loop is identified by cycling the magnetic field continuously from the maximum positive to the maximum negative value and back. This then allowed identifying the anhysteretic curve.
