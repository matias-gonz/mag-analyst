Curve type: 
* Anhysteretic curve

Material: 
* A grain-oriented silicon steel sheet, cut parallel to the rolling direction, longitudinally compressed up to 67 MPa.

Details of the material's preparation and measurement:
* The quasistatic loop was measured along the rolling direction of the steel sheets, which corresponds to the surface-parallel easy axis.
