Curve type:
* Anhysteretic curve

Material:
* An iron-based nanocrystalline alloy (Fe73.5Cu1Nb3Si15.5B7, under the trademark NANOPERM LM from Magnetec Company) with induced in-plane uniaxial anisotropy, measured transverse to the preferred direction.

Details of the measurement:
* Acquired by the fluxmetric method on a toroidal wound sample. Measurements were carried out with a magnetizing field frequency of 0.5 Hz at room temperature using a digitally controlled hysteresisgraph.
