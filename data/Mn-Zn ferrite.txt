Curve type:
* Anhysteretic curve

Material:
* A soft ferrite (Mn0.51Zn0.44Fe2.05O4) with very low anisotropy

Details of the measurement:
* Acquired by the fluxmetric method on a toroidal sample. Measurements were carried out with a magnetizing field frequency of 0.5 Hz at room temperature using a digitally controlled hysteresisgraph.
