Curve type: 
* Anhysteretic curve

Material: 
* Fe73.5Si13.5B9Nb3Cu1 nanocrystalline alloy with induced transverse anisotropy.

Details of the material's preparation and measurement:
* Wound toroids first nanocrystallized at 540°C for 1 h with no field and subsequently annealed at 350°C with a magnetic field applied transverse to the ribbon axis (i.e., transverse field annealing). The hysteresis loops were measured along the circumferential direction of the toroids.
